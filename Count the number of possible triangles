Given an unsorted array arr[] of n positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of triangles. 

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 3
arr[] = {3, 5, 4}
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
A triangle is possible 
with all the elements 5, 3 and 4.




def countTriangles(arr, n):
    if n < 3:
        return 0

    arr.sort()
    count = 0

    for i in range(n - 2):
        k = i + 2
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            while k < n and arr[i] + arr[j] > arr[k]:
                k += 1
            count += k - j - 1

    return count

# Example usage
n = 3
arr = [3, 5, 4]
result = countTriangles(arr, n)
print(result)
